Kubernetes 
----------
* kubernetes is a container orchestrartion software
* k8s is a disturbuted application software whis is called cluster
* This orchestration is done in the concept od master(minions) and nodes
* master node they do the orchestrartion and nodes(slaves) they perform/does the work assigned by the master
* It can do self healing and manage the application  and it maintains actualstate=desired state
* k8s is developed by the google by the experience of running the containers and it has the in house product called omega and borg
* K8s has its  DNA from google. it was donated as a opensource project to CNCF(Cloud Native Computing Foundation)
* K8s is designed to work with any container technology Ex docker is mostly used in the industry

* master node: we intrect with the master nodes, to interect with the master node we have (API) calling/understanding
 There are 2 ways 
 1. JSON
 2. Code/restapi
 another one is through the (CMD) kind of application 
  this is through:   Kubectl: commands(imperative approch)
                               Yaml(decelerative approch
cluster: 
    master: assignes the work
    node: does the work
 above are the 2 ways to interect with the k8s to expose API   

 actualstate=desiredstate
 ------------------------
* k8s always works on what is desired state (changed state)
Manifests: Yaml files are the way of expressing our desired state and those are called as manifests
* We create the Yaml manefiest to express the  desired state and k8s master ensures that the desired state to be running

K8s is the software that is installed on the server that software runs/creates the orchestration platform
